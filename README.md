# mkdocs-extract-listings-plugin

A small plugin to extract all your listings and put them in a single page.
Might for example be useful if the search plugin makes it hard finding a code snippet you want to find (or you disabled the search).
Just open the page with all listings and use the `Find in page` function.

## TODO

1. Convert to plugin (needs config)
2. Convert to a python package
3. Publish on PyPI
